Predicting La LIga matches

## The Full La Liga Dataset
This dataset encompasses match outcomes for every La Liga game from the 1995-1996 season to the 2023-2024 season, up to Matchday 8, and it also includes half-time scores.

The creation of this dataset was motivated by the need for more straightforward, league-specific data. Rather than sifting through extensive datasets containing results from various European matches, having smaller, league-specific datasets streamlines the process of analysis.

The dataset comprises columns such as Season, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG (Full-time home goals), FTAG (Full-time away goals), FTR (Full-time result), HTHG (Half-time home goals), HTAG (Half-time away goals), and HTR (Half-time result).

These results have been sourced from the site, a UK-based football betting platform. While they provide datasets for each separate season, I have consolidated them into a single dataset to enhance convenience and usability.
